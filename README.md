# ECE59500: Automated LLM Trustworthiness Testing

This repository contains the final project for the ECE59500 course. The objective is to design and execute an automated testing plan to evaluate the trustworthiness of two Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project focuses on a specific dimension of trustworthiness: **explicit machine ethics**. We are testing how models respond to high-ambiguity moral scenarios where the governing principle is "Do not break the law" from both male and female based roles.
